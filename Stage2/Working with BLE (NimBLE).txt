üîπ Stage 2 ‚Äì Working with BLE (NimBLE)
Step 1: Learn BLE Scanning

Goal: Understand how the ESP32 scans for nearby BLE devices.

What to Learn:

How to enable BLE scanning in ESP-IDF using NimBLE.

How to list detected devices (name, MAC address, and type).

How to extract the RSSI (signal strength) of each device.

Step 2: Extract and Use RSSI

Goal: Learn how to read and use RSSI values.

What to Learn:

How to log RSSI values for each scanned device.

How to filter devices based on RSSI (e.g., detect if a device is near or far).

This prepares you for proximity-based logic (e.g., unlocking a door if your phone is close).

Step 3: Practice GATT Communication (Client ‚Üî Server)

Goal: Understand the two BLE roles and make them communicate.

What to Learn:

Difference between GATT Server (ESP32 or phone) and GATT Client (ESP32 or phone).

How to set up ESP32 as a GATT Server (expose services & characteristics).

How to set up ESP32 as a GATT Client (read/write to another device‚Äôs services).

Simple experiments:

ESP32 Server ‚Üî Phone App Client.

ESP32 Client ‚Üî Phone App Server.

Step 4: Build a Simple ‚ÄúChallenge‚Äù

Goal: Add a basic security mechanism.

What to Learn:

Send a small piece of data (challenge) from ESP32 to phone.

Phone responds with the correct reply.

ESP32 verifies the reply before granting access (like a digital handshake).

Example:

ESP32 sends random number 1234.

Phone must reply with 5678 (predefined rule).

If correct ‚Üí ESP32 accepts.

‚è≥ Estimated time to complete Stage 2: 3‚Äì4 weeks

Week 1: BLE Scanning + RSSI

Week 2: GATT Basics (Server ‚Üî Client)

Week 3‚Äì4: Challenge mechanism + practice

üëâ The main goal of this stage:

Be able to scan, filter, and connect to BLE devices,

Understand GATT communication,

Implement a basic secure exchange between ESP32 and a smartphone.
